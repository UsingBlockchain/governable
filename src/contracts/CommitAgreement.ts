/**
 * @class Governable.CommitAgreement
 * @package Governable
 * @subpackage Contracts
 * @since v1.0.0
 * @description Class that describes a contract for finalizing
 * a DAO launch agreement. Operators must be the same as those
 * whom previously executed the `CreateAgreement` contract.
 *
 * The funds locked by secret are hereby unlocked and owned by
 * the agreed upon target public account of the DAO.
 *
 * @see {Governable.CreateAgreement}
 * @summary
 * This digital contract accepts the following arguments:
 *
 * | Argument | Description | Example |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | agreement | Agreement public account | `new PublicAccount(...)` |
 *
 * The execution of this contract results in the creation of
 * the following list of transactions with  their respective
 * *signer* and a description:
 *
 * | Sequence | Type | Signer | Description |
 * | --- | --- | --- | --- |
 * | 01 | SecretProof | Agreement Account | Proves the **agreement of operators** to start a DAO with the included **governance asset identifier**. |
 * | 02 | TransferTransaction | Agreement Account | Sends information containing the **target account public key** that is hereby being agreed upon. |
 * | 03 | TransferTransaction | Agreement Account | Adds an execution proof message sent to the **agreement account**. |
