/**
 * @class Governable.CreateAgreement
 * @package Governable
 * @subpackage Contracts
 * @since v1.0.0
 * @description Class that describes a contract for starting a
 * DAO launch agreement with associates (other operators), and
 * thereby initiating the process of creation of a distributed
 * organization.
 * Note that the first listed operator account will *fund* the
 * account used for the *agreement* with 1 `symbol.xym`.  This
 * amount is sent to the **target** account when the agreement
 * has been commited and confirmed by the network.
 *
 * @summary
 * This digital contract accepts the following arguments:
 *
 * | Argument | Description | Example |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | password | A password to protect a mnemonic pass phrase | `'...'` |
 * | mnemonic | BIP39 mnemonic pass phrase to derive child accounts. | `new MnemonicPassPhrase(...)` |
 * | agreementPath | BIP44 derivation path to derive **agreement** account. | `'...'` |
 * | operators | Operators public accounts | `[new PublicAccount(...)]` |
 *
 * The execution of this contract results in the creation of
 * the following list of transactions with  their respective
 * *signer* and a description:
 *
 * | Sequence | Type | Signer | Description |
 * | --- | --- | --- | --- |
 * | 01 | MultisigAccountModificationTransaction | Agreement Account + Operators | Converts the **agreement account** in a multi-signature account where **cosignatories** are the **operator accounts**. |
 * | 02 | SecretLockTransaction | Operator Account | The *secret* used is the resulting **governance asset identifier**. If *unlocked*, sends an initial amount of `symbol.xym` to the **target account**. If not unlocked, expecting new agreement, with different *secret*. |
 * | 03 | TransferTransaction | Agreement Account | Sends information containing the **target account public key** that must be agreed upon in a subsequent `CommitAgreement` contract execution. |
 * | 04 | TransferTransaction | Agreement Account | Adds an execution proof message sent to the **agreement account**. |
