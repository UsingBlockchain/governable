 * A distributed organization is represented by the following properties,
 * which have to be agreed upon by operators during an initial launch agreement:
 *
 * - An agreement transaction: Consists of a multi-signature account which uses
 *   `SecretLockTransaction` and `TransferTransaction` to prove a DAO agreement
 *   of operators on-chain.
 *
 * - A target account: Consists of a public account that was agreed upon by
 *   operators to represent the distributed organization as an entity. This
 *   account will be converted to a multi-signature account where cosigners
 *   are the operators of the DAO.
 *
 * - A governance mosaic: Consists of a digital asset that is created only
 *   for the purposes of keeping track of operators' ability to help with
 *   decision making in a distributed organization. Governance mosaics are
 *   always non-transferrable. This implies that a *transfer* of authority
 *   is not possible and enforces an *agreement* to be persisted on-chain.
